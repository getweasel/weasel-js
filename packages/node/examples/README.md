# Examples using Touca SDK for Node.js

The examples in this directory serve to introduce high-level and low-level
APIs of the Touca SDK for Node.js package.

* [`is_prime`](./is_prime)

  This simple example introduces the high-level API of the Node.js SDK.
  While the code is too trivial to show all the power and features of the SDK,
  it captures the fundamental design ideas and is a good starting point when
  writing your own Touca tests.
